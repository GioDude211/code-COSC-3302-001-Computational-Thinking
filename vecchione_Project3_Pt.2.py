Description: Numerical Integration
Find the area below the curve of f(x) = .34x^2 + 2.98x + 1.53 from x = 2 to x = 4 and above the x axis. Use the method of rectangles as described in class.
Choose a tolerance, tol,  and an initial number of sub-intervals, n. Calculate the approximate area. Repeat the calculation with a greater n and continue the process until successive approximations have a difference less than tol. Report all choices and results.
